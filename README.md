### Key Features

Some of the most ~~challenging~~ interesting features I made include:

1. **The Home Screen itself**

Due to how this screen had to have components that presented a little bit of eveeything in other
screens, it was nearly a pain in the neck for optimization. With the use of hooks like `useMemo`,
however, optimization was achieved and is still being improved.

The interface highlighted `Red` is the component controlled by the App's owner to distribute
brief surveys for improvement of TEAM App.

The interface highlighted `Green` is a component that displays status of a member (of Hary
organisation, in this case) using animations of `react-native-animated-numbers`.

<br>

The time count interface highlighted `Deep Blue` is a component using `date-fns` for logic.
It was tricky to implement (as is every other internationally synchronous counter). The
component shows the countdown till its larent component expires for members of organisation.

The interface highlighted `Deep Purple` is a component that displays whichever date its parent component
is uploaded.

2. **Tasks Screen**

I named this one "Lord of Expenses".

This screen shows tasks given by admin ('management' in TEAM App) to members, with slightly
different components for admin's and members' interface.

<br>

3. **Members Screen**

This screen displays for only management.  
It contains information of all signed in members of organisation for recording and status check.

<br>

4. **Activities Screen**

This screen was particularly interesting to create because of its child components' UI, which had to
be manually constructed.

<br>

5. **Congratulations Screen**

This is my favorite screen yet, and I don't even know why.  
This screen displays when members win "Impacts" or "Badges". Read more [about impacts and
badges](/READMEForUsers.md).
